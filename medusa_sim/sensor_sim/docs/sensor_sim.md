# Sensor Sim: readme.md

## Project Description

This package implements basic sensor models for an underwater/surface vehicles. It has the following features - Simulate GPS, Depth, DVL (Bottom Track and Water Track), Altitude, AHRS, Ranges - Control Gaussian Noise and Measurement Noise - Control Sensor Publish Frequency - Publish State output of the dynamic model in *auv_msgs::NavigationStatus* format

## Getting Started

### Installation

Pkg `sensor_sim` comes as part of the medusa_vx stack.

## Configuration

This section explains how to write the node configuration file. Sample are given below

```

1. topics/publishers: parameter of type *string[7]*

   - Defines the output topics - [position, velocity, orientation, gnss, range, model, thruster]
- position topic is used to publish DEPTH & ALTIMETER measurements of type *medusa_msgs::Measurement*
   - velocity topic is used to publish DVL_BT, DVL_WT measurements of type *medusa_msgs::Measurement*
- orientation topic is used to publish AHRS measurements of type *medusa_msgs::Measurement*
   - gnss topic is used for GNSS measurements in WGS84 of type *sensor_msgs::NavSatFix*
- range topic is used for single beacon measurements of type *medusa_msgs::mUSBLFix*
   
2. topics/subscribers: parameter of type *string[1]*

   - position topic to receive the dynamic state of the vehicle in *nav_msgs::Odometry*

3. **water_column**: Length of water column (We assume that water column is constant)

**sensors**: Sensors to be simulated are described as a list of type . Any number of sensors may be defined following the format described below.

1. type: parameter of type *string*

   - Defines the type of sensor to be simulated. Current available sensors are "GNSS", "DVL_WT", "DVL_BT", "AHRS", "DEPTH", "ALTIMETER", "RANGE", "MODEL"

2. frame_id: parameter of type *string*

   - Frame id of the simulated sensor, must be unique

3. frequency: parameter of type *double*

   - Controls how often the sensor publishes data

4. count: parameter of type *int*

   - Sensor stops publishing after this many outputs
- Put 0 for infinite
   
5. noise: parameter of type *double*

   - gaussian noise added to the sensor

6. variance: parameter of type *double*

   - In addition to the gaussian noise, a constant value is added while publishing the sensor value and variance.
- Its main purpose is to easily tune the measurement noise being fed to the filter
   - This value has no effect while adding noise to the sensor!

## Launching the Node

An example launch file is provided below where `sensor_sim/sensor_sim`.

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
    <arg name="name" default="myellow"/>
    <node pkg="sensor_sim" type="sensor_sim" name="sensor_sim" respawn="false" output="screen">
        <rosparam command="load" file="$(find sensor_sim)/config/sensors.yaml"/>
    </node>
</launch>
```
